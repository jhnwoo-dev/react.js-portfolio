# React.js Portfolio

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio application! This portfolio was built using React.js to provide a simple, user-friendly page that would showcase my projects.
This project contains a short personal about me section, a portfolio portion that displays a few of my projects, a contact page, and my resume.

## Installation

To install my portfolio page, clone the repository to a directory of your choice and head to the terminal where you will run the command "npm i" to install the dependencies necessary to start the server. Once the dependencies have been installed, run the command "npm start" to begin the live server - from there navigate to the live page at http://localhost:3000/.
